			<p>School of Computer and Information Sciences (SCIS) offers high quality postgraduate teaching and research in all major areas of Computer and Information Sciences, Artificial 					Intelligence, and, Banking Technology and Information Security. Computer Science programme in University of Hyderabad was started in 1983 under the School of Mathematics 					and Computer/Information Sciences. Computer and Information Sciences was carved out as a separate Department under the School of Mathematics and Computer/Information 					Sciences on March 23, 1993. This department became School of Computer and Information Sciences on January 22, 2013.
			</p>
			<p>
				SCIS epitomizes excellence in all major functions associated with higher learning such as teaching, research, student development and curriculum planning. The strengths of 					the School are its quality faculty, innovative and flexible curricula with their unique focus on post-graduate education, state-of-the-art research with a remarkably high 					number of Ph.D scholars - both ongoing and recently graduated, and highly open and transparent policies that foster a healthy student-faculty interaction. SCIS always stood 					for innovation and leadership in curriculum planning - having one of the oldest (from 1983) and even now one of the best MCA programmes; boldly proposing and introducing 					the M. Tech programme in Artificial Intelligence in 1986 to attract the small but growing number of undergraduates in computer science; and, in 2002, introducing the unique 					M. Tech in Information Technology (with specialization in Banking Technology and Information Security) in collaboration with IDRBT (Institute for Development and Research 					in Banking Technology, a sister Institute of RBI) aimed at bridging the shortfall of trained computer professionals in banking and finance industries.

				he teaching methods further reflect our pursuit of excellence. Classrooms are equipped with LCD projectors for courses that benefit from the use of live demonstrations and 					computer presentations to blackboards for those that require greater flexibility in pace and structure of lecture delivery. Web-based materials and assignments are also 					used and several classes have been experimentally delivered using locally developed electronic course content and delivery tools. Our laboratories also reflect the unique 					dichotomy of our curricula with general-purpose ones for core subjects and several specialized ones such as networking lab, speech processing lab, computational 					intelligence lab, embedded systems lab and software engineering lab for the newest electives. Access to such laboratories is provided to students and faculty on 24/7/365 					basis.
			</p>
			<p>
				Students come through a rigorous admission process and leave with an all-round experience of quality education not bound by the conventions of dated syllabi and evaluation 					processes that emphasize rote learning. Apart from faculty and research scholars, M.Tech and MCA students also participate in exciting research which sharpens their 					problem-solving and analytical skills, thus, giving them a competitive edge over their counterparts. In addition, students come from all over the country and the School is 					beginning to attract the attention of international students. The diversity of the student community and the technical strength of the different programmes are recognized 					by many distinguished multi-national and other high-end companies that find our students technically superior with excellent problem-solving skills and great cultural 					awareness.
			</p>
			<p>
				The unique combination of quality teaching of core concepts and cutting edge electives by excellent faculty, exposure to the latest technologies and research leading to 					publications in major journals/conferences and accessibility to high-end computing facilities including supercomputers in a completely open informal atmosphere make SCIS a 					torch-bearer for postgraduate education in computer science in India.
